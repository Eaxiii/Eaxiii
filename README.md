Hello GitHub community! I'm Eaxiii
 A math enthusiast turned data curious. With a university background in mathematics, 
 
 I'm excited to explore the world of data analysis and web development. 
 Although new to the scene, I've got a solid foundation in statistical applications and experience working with Excel, PowerBI, SQL, and Tableau. 
 
 
 When I'm not crunching numbers, you can find me cheering on my favorite football team or diving into research papers. 
 I'm passionate about calculation and research, and I'm eager to learn from and contribute to this community.
 Let's connect and create something amazing!
